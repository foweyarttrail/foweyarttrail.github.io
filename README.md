The file must start and end with `---` that's just the way life is I'm afraid

`layout` : stop ("its a stop on the trail")

`title` : the title to display when someone clicks on the map - and the title for the stop in the descriptions

`latitude`, `longitude` : a pain in the arse, get these from dropping a pin onto google maps in the right place

`number` : this must be a UNIQUE, number for the stop, displays the number on the map and in the descriptions

`hours` : free text - this appears under the title of the stop in the description section

`other` : free text - any other info - displayed after the hours in the description section

`icons` : you can pick any icon you can see here : https://materializecss.com/icons.html
 
 You must use 2 spaces then a dash '-' then a space, then the icon name
    ```
    icons:
      - ac_unit
      - account_balance
     ```
     
`exhibitors` : a list of exhibitors - be a bit careful here

### each exhibitor is started with a `- name:` everything up to the next `- name:` or the end of the file is about that exhibitor
    
    `  - name` : Their name
    
    `type`: The type of work they do (e.g. Oil Painting)
